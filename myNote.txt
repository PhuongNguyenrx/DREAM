Ön the çlocktower, the sñaӄě that plaǧues the city feasts at 3 AM.
2 Sӄulls were abdücted
The ümbrella of the q̾ueen clöse to the 4th ǧilded q̾uiet p̾iǧeon statue.
7 V̾engeant j̾ack̾als cürse those that mistreated them
ǧood żest of 4 or̾anǧes t͎ak̾en will undöubtedly ǧreatly yield heap̾s of v̾alue.

The second twilight shall bring salvation to us all.
